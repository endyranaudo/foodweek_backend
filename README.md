# Overview

FoodWeek is a food planner app.
Users can create his food week plan browsing more than 360K recipes.
Once a user finds a recipe, he can add all the missing ingredients to the shopping list.

# Motivation

This app was built as the final project for the Flatiron School Software Engineering Bootcamp. I have built the entire application in two weeks.
I built this app because, as I love cooking, I needed a food planner with these features 

# Server

The backend API was built using Ruby on Rails with a PostgreSQL database. 
I'm fetching data (recipes) from Spoonacular API.

# Client

The client-side of the application is built in React.
The frontend design was made using Semantic UI and CSS.This can be found in the following [GitHub repository](https://github.com/endyranaudo/foodweek_frontend).


# User Journeys

As a user, I'll log in and be redirected to the Dashboard.
On the Dashboard, I can check my weekly calendar, update it with new recipes from the recipe search. Once I get all the recipe details, I can add to the shopping list all the ingredients needed for the recipe preparation. 
I can also access my shopping list from the top menu and add manually any other extra product I need to buy.
